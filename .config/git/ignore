## Global gitignore ##
#
## Only put personal OS/IDE files here                   ##
## Lang-specific caches should be in project .gitignore  ##

# NOTE: While files in .gitignore are rarely committed,
# this is really just a suggestion. Git works perfectly
# fine if there are commited files (or ones in the index)
# that are also in the gitignore.
#
# The gitignroe simply means that by default, git command
# will ignore local modifications and `git add` will never
# add any changes to the index.
#
# However, both of these behaviors can be overriden!
#
# To add ignored files, use `git add --force <file>`
# Once added to the index, git will notice your changes
# and treat them as if they were never ignored in the
# first place.

# Python
# __pycache__
#
# NO: Because if the project uses Python, it should exclude it.

# Ignore EditorConfig by default (https://editorconfig.org)
#
# In projects that I don't own, my default settings may be
# incompatible with the project style. Adding or modifying
# the project-local editorconfnig file would be preferrable,
# but isn't something I would want to contribute upstream.
#
# In projects that I do own, I can use `git add --force`
# to add any changes to the config that I want.
