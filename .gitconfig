    # This is done to improve performance of `git status`

    # Enabling `core.untrackedCache` would also help significantly.
    # This is part of a set of options enabled by feature.manyFiles.
    # The time for `git status` with a warm fsmonitor cache goes from
    # 1s with core.fsmonitor alone to 100ms with feature.manyFiles option.
    #
    # The only downside to `core.untrackedCache` is it relies on accurate mtime,
    # which I am not willing to assume on every system I own
    # given the importance of git's correctness.

    # As such, I only enable `feature.manyFiles` on a repo-by-repo basis,
    # instead of globaly.
