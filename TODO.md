# TODO
Things that should be done.

## Easy
* Give warning when using `mamba` python (see deleted conda `changeps1` option)
* Refactor code to seperate from config

## Medium
* Introduce config files and start to move some functionality away from scripts

## Hard
* Rewrite scripts in either a DSL, Lua, or Janet
